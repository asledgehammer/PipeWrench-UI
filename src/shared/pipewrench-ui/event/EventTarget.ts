 *
 * Element, and its children, as well as [../node/Document.ts] and [../node/Window.ts], are the most
 * common event targets, but other objects can be event targets, too. For example `IDBRequest`,
 * `AudioNode`, and `AudioContext` are also event targets.
 * 
 * Many event targets (including elements, documents, and windows) also support setting event
 * handlers via `onevent` properties and attributes.

     * @param listener The object that receives a notification (an object that implements the

     * `null`, an object with a `handleEvent()` method, or a JavaScript function. See The event

     * element that is nested within another element, when both elements have registered a handle
     * for that event. The event propagation mode determines the order in which elements receive the
     * event. See DOM Level 3 Events and JavaScript Event order for a detailed explanation. If not
